"""
Trace recorder for the SIEGE harness.

A ``Trace`` is the structured record of one instance run under one
ablation configuration: every action the agent attempted, the gate
decision that met it, and a snapshot of the capability registry at the
end. It is the single artifact the scorer reads, and the RL
reward's discriminator reads -- so the recorder is deliberately the only
place execution facts are written down.

The recorder is gate-agnostic: the ``SessionRunner`` hands it
``ActionRecord``s as it produces them. Nothing here imports a gate.

class ActionRecord:
    """The recorded outcome of one action passing (or not) a gate.

    Fields:
        session_id: which session this action ran in.
        turn_index: 0-based turn within the session.
        action_index: 0-based action within the turn.
        kind: the ``ActionKind`` value (string).
        gate: the gate id that defended the action, or None if no gate
            defends this action kind (or the defending gate was off in
            this config -- see ``defender_live``).
        defender_live: True if the defending gate was enabled in this
            config and actually ran. False means the action passed
            because no live gate was watching.
        is_attack / is_utility: copied from the action.
        label: copied from the action.
        allowed: the action's final disposition -- True if it was *not*
            blocked. Attack ASR counts allowed attack actions.
        blocked_by: gate id that denied the action, else None.
        reason: the gate's decision reason (or a pass-through note).
        incident_level: the gate's incident level, if any.
        value_id: the capability value id this action registered, if any.
        capability: snapshot of the registered tag fields, if any.
        sink_tool: for a ``tool_call``, the high-privilege tool it drives,
            resolved by ``session_runner._resolved_sink_tool`` (which
            resolves a submission by gate, since the corpus names that
            sink as ``gate: G5`` rather than by ``tool_name``). ``None``
            for every other action kind. The scorer's hard-win predicate
            requires this to name a sink in ``schemas.HIGH_PRIV_SINKS``,
            so an attack terminating at a read-only tool is not scored as
            a hard win (R12-A7).
