B3.8 -- hybrid-retrieval seam attack.

VISTA serves salt-property values from two retrieval surfaces: a
*structured* database (MSTDB-TP) and *unstructured* PDFs indexed in the
RAG corpus. The seam between them is exploitable: a poisoned PDF chunk
can impersonate the authoritative structured-DB record and override the
real database value, so an agent that fuses the two surfaces trusts the
forgery over the canonical table.

Each chunk claims to be the structured MSTDB-TP record (table id, field
label, "authoritative database value") for a salt-property pair, while
carrying a value that contradicts the real database. The axis varies how
the chunk dresses itself up as the structured source.

Most of these carry no overt injection phrasing (they mimic a database
row, not an instruction), so the G3 fast-tier regex generally does NOT
fire -- the defense is the hybrid-seam / source-precedence
contract that pins structured-DB authority to the real database, not to
a PDF claiming to be it.

Reference: structured/unstructured retrieval-seam poisoning (source
precedence spoofing in hybrid RAG).
