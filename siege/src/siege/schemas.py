"""
Frozen instance / trace / scorer schemas for SIEGE.

These dataclasses are the *format contract* the work item calls for,
frozen so template authoring doesn't churn the format. Instances live
on disk as YAML (or JSON); this module is the
in-memory shape the loader produces and the runner / scorer consume.

The canonical JSON-Schema serialization of the *instance* format lives
next to this module at ``schemas/instance.schema.json`` and is what an
external collaborator validates their authored instances
against. ``instance_loader.validate_instance_dict`` checks loaded
documents against it. The trace and scorer schemas are Python-internal
(produced, never authored by hand) so they are pinned here in code
rather than as authoring schemas.

## The execution model

A SIEGE *instance* models one attack (or one benign task) as a
sequence of **sessions**, each a sequence of **turns**, each a sequence
of **actions**. An action is the atomic unit the harness routes through
a gate:

- ``PROMPT``   -- a user/agent prompt. Defended by **G1**.
- ``TOOL_CALL``-- a tool invocation (``run_bash``, ``create_file``,
  ``submit_hpc_job``, ...). Defended by **G2** (generic), **G4**
  (code), or **G5** (HPC) depending on the tool.
- ``MEMORY_WRITE`` -- the agent writes a value into the in-process turn
  buffer (the cross-session substrate for one episode). The *plant* half
  of a multi-turn sequence.
- ``MEMORY_READ``  -- the agent retrieves from the turn buffer. Defended
  by **G3**. The *retrieve-and-act* half. (Durable cross-session memory,
  and the MINJA/MemoryGraft sequences it enables, are deferred (out of
  scope for this release) -- see ``siege/deferred/``.)
- ``RAG_RETRIEVE`` -- a retrieval against a corpus. Defended by **G3**.
- ``RESPONSE``     -- final assistant text. Not gated; the scorer reads
  it for utility / leak checks.

Authoring an instance is "what would the compromised agent *attempt*":
the harness supplies the real gates, the ablation matrix toggles which
gates are live, and the scorer reads whether the attack-flagged actions
got through. This mirrors the existing per-gate eval runners
(``g1_runner`` et al.), generalized to multi-session episodes with a
shared memory substrate.

Every dataclass here is ``frozen=True`` so a loaded instance can't be
mutated mid-run -- the same immutability discipline the rest of
PALISADE uses for capability tags.
