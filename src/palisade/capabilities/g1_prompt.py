`G1PromptCapability` -- the PydanticAI-hook adapter for the G1 Prompt
Gate.

Before this migration, G1 was wired into VISTA through two bespoke
seams in ``agents.py``:

1. An *early-rejection block* at the top of ``run_stream``'s
   ``agent_stream`` that called ``sidecar.evaluate_user_prompt(...)``
   and, on deny, short-circuited with a synthetic result event.
2. A ``@agent.system_prompt`` *tier banner* that prepended
   ``[PALISADE] Session tier: <TIER>`` to the system prompt when G1
   was active.

Both are now expressed as hooks on a single capability:

- ``before_run`` runs ``sidecar.evaluate_user_prompt(...)`` and, on a
  deny decision, raises `PalisadeDeny`. ``agents.py`` catches that
  exception in the run-stream wrapper and emits the same synthetic
  terminal event (empty ``new_messages`` + zeroed ``RunUsage``) the
  early-rejection block used to emit. Keeping the deny path as an
  exception means the abort happens from inside PydanticAI's run
  machinery -- the model is never requested.
- ``before_model_request`` prepends the tier banner as the first
  ``SystemPromptPart`` of the first ``ModelRequest``. Unlike the old
  ``@agent.system_prompt`` (which only contributed to the *first*
  model call's prompt construction), this fires on *every* model
  request, so when trust scoring transitions the tier
  mid-run the agent sees the updated banner on the next call.

The capability delegates all policy to the existing G1 gate via the
sidecar (``evaluate_user_prompt`` already runs G1 fast + slow tiers and
records incidents). This issue is a *migration*, not a rewrite: the
gate's ``check_fast`` / ``extract_intent`` logic and its unit tests are
untouched.
