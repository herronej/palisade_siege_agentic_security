`PalisadeCapability` -- the PydanticAI-capability base class every
PALISADE gate adapter subclasses.

PALISADE is built on PydanticAI's `AbstractCapability` + Hooks API
rather than a bespoke `process_tool_call` composition. Each gate
(G1..G7) is exposed to the agent as an `AbstractCapability` subclass
that registers the relevant hooks (`before_run`, `before_tool_execute`,
`after_tool_execute`, ...) and delegates the actual policy decision to
the gate's existing `check_fast` / `check_slow` logic.

This module holds the shared base class; the per-gate subclasses
(`G1PromptCapability`, `G2ToolCapability`, ...) build on it.

## Responsibilities of the base class

- Hold a reference to the owning `PalisadeSidecar` so subclass hooks
  can reach the per-session capability registry, trust scorer, and
  Q-LLM agents. The sidecar is threaded into hooks via
  `RunContext.deps`; the reference stored here is the construction-time
  handle the subclass uses to build that context.
- Hold the underlying `Gate` instance. The gate keeps its own
  `check_fast` / `extract_intent` / `sanitize_chunks` methods, which
  the existing per-gate unit tests exercise directly. Keeping the gate
  as a delegate (rather than folding its logic into the capability)
  means those tests continue to pass untouched through the migration.
- Provide `is_enabled()`, the single place the master flag and the
  per-gate flag are AND-ed together. A disabled capability is a no-op:
  subclass hooks check `is_enabled()` first and return early when off.

## Why a custom ``__init__`` rather than dataclass fields

`AbstractCapability` is itself a (field-less) dataclass, but PALISADE
capabilities carry live collaborator references (a sidecar, a gate)
rather than serializable config, so a plain constructor is clearer than
dataclass fields. PydanticAI's `for_run` default returns ``self`` and
the framework never reconstructs a capability via `dataclasses.replace`,
so overriding `__init__` is safe.
