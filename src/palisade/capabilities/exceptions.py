Exceptions raised by PALISADE capabilities.

These are control-flow signals, not error conditions: a capability hook
raises one to abort the agent run from *inside* PydanticAI's hook
machinery, and `agents.py` catches it in the `run_stream` wrapper to
emit a structured refusal in place of the agent's normal output.
