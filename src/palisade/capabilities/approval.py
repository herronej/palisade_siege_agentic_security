"""
`PalisadeApprovalCapability` -- human-in-the-loop approval for
high-stakes tool calls.

PydanticAI natively supports human-in-the-loop tool approval: a tool
registered with ``requires_approval=True`` (or one that raises
``ApprovalRequired``) pauses the run and surfaces a
`DeferredToolRequests`. This capability implements the
``handle_deferred_tool_calls`` hook to resolve those approvals *inline*
during the run -- it asks the user (through a caller-supplied
``request_approval`` callback) and returns a `DeferredToolResults`
approving or denying each call.

VISTA wires ``request_approval`` to the same event stream +
``resolve_elicitation(action, content)`` surface the frontend already
uses, so no new client API is required. This is the surface G5's
``submit_hpc_job`` plugs into via ``@tool(requires_approval=True)``
instead of a bespoke flow.

Unlike the gate capabilities, this one is pure infrastructure: it has
no `Gate` and no per-session state, so it subclasses
`AbstractCapability` directly rather than `PalisadeCapability`.
