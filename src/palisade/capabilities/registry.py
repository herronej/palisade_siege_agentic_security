Capability tagging for PALISADE.

This module implements the *capability registry* described in the
PALISADE architecture: every value that crosses a boundary (B1-B7)
carries a `CapabilityTag` describing its provenance, sensitivity, and
trust. Tags live in a per-session `CapabilityRegistry` that gates
consult to make policy decisions.

The structural argument that PALISADE makes about adaptive attackers
rests on this module: capabilities are stored in the
interpreter, not in the LLM's context window. A compromised Q-LLM can
fail to *detect* that a chunk contains an instruction, but it cannot
*remove* the chunk's `taint=True` tag from the registry, because
nothing the LLM produces is ever a registry write. All registry writes
go through deliberate `tag(...)` or `propagate(...)` calls in
PALISADE gate code.

To enforce this in practice, `CapabilityTag` is frozen: derived tags
are produced by calling `propagate(...)`, which returns and registers
a new tag computed from inputs. Direct field mutation is not
supported.

## Composition semantics

When a value is derived from multiple inputs (e.g., the agent passes
two tool returns into a third tool), the derived value's capability
must be at least as restrictive as any input. We use the lattice
join:

- `sensitivity`: maximum along the order
  OPEN < INTERNAL < CUI < EXPORT_CONTROLLED.
- `taint`: logical OR (any tainted input -> tainted output).
- `dual_use`: maximum along a precedence order
  NONE < CYBER < CHEM < BIO < NUCLEAR. A future enhancement may
  change this to `frozenset[DualUseMarker]` so that a value derived
  from BIO and CHEM inputs carries both markers without collapsing;
  changing this is API-compatible because callers go through
  `propagate(...)`.
- `provenance_chain`: appended with `f"{sink}<-({source_ids})"` so
  the audit trail records both the originating sources and the
  operation that combined them.
- `metadata`: shallow union of input metadata (later inputs win on
  key collisions); the merging policy is intentionally simple because
  metadata is informational, not enforcement-bearing.
