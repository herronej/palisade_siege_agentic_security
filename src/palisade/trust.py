"""
PALISADE trust scorer and tier policy.

This module holds the per-session trust state as plain Python on the
sidecar -- the "capabilities live in the interpreter, not the LLM
context" principle from the proposal. Nothing here calls a model or
does I/O.

## Per-capability Bayesian credit assignment

The scorer kept a single session-wide float. replaces
it with one ``Beta(alpha, beta)`` posterior *per capability kind* (the
gate that produced the signal: ``"G1"``..``"G5"``, or any caller-chosen
label). Every signal updates exactly one capability's posterior:

  * a clean call adds success mass to that capability's ``alpha``;
  * a violation adds failure mass to that capability's ``beta``, scaled
    by the event's severity and whether it is high-stakes.

Because the posteriors are independent, an oscillation attacker who
trips the RAG gate (G3) cannot wash out the breach by running a stream
of clean tool calls (G2): clean G2 calls only ever touch G2's posterior.
This is the structural property acceptance-tested in
``test_trust_bayesian.py``.

A capability's tier is derived from its posterior mean via the
configured thresholds (`TierPolicy`). The session-level tier
(`current_tier`) is the *worst* tier across all capabilities, so a
single breached boundary degrades the whole session.

## Sticky high-stakes 

A high-stakes violation ratchets a per-capability *floor* tier that the
capability can never climb back above within the session, even if later
events are benign. This defeats the probe-then-strike oscillation
attack where an adversary alternates good/bad behavior to recover a
breached high-stakes capability. The floor is cleared only by
`reset()` (a full session reset); explicit re-authentication is wired
in a later issue. When ``settings.sticky_high_stakes`` is False (used
only for the oscillation benchmark) the floor is not applied and tiers
recover normally.

## Backwards-compatible surface

The API that gates written in Phases 1-4 depend on is
preserved unchanged:

  * `record_violation(severity, *, capability_kind=...)`
  * `record_clean_call(...)`
  * `notify_incident(*, level, gate)` -- called by `IncidentManager`
  * `current_tier()`, `current_score`, `reset()`
  * `TierPolicy`, `policy`, `history`, `last_violation`

With no events (or only clean events) and the default
``initial_trust=1.0``, every capability mean is 1.0 and the tier is
NORMAL -- byte-for-byte the idle behavior.

        Sticky high-stakes capabilities (G5-above-ceiling,
        G6-destructive, G3-CUI,...) do not auto-recover within a
        session: clean calls rebuild the posterior but the sticky floor
        holds the tier down, so a probe-then-strike oscillation attacker
        cannot wash out a breach. The *only* thing that lifts the lock is
        an explicit human re-auth, which is what this method models.

        Re-auth restores each sticky-locked capability to its prior
        (clearing the floor and the sticky flag) and empties the
        sticky-denied registry, so the previously locked capabilities
        become usable again. Non-sticky capabilities -- which already
        auto-recover via clean calls -- and the violation history are
        left untouched, so the audit trail of what happened this session
        survives the re-auth.

        Re-auth also clears the SEV2 escalation floor and the
        re-auth-required flag. It does *not* revive a SEV1-terminated
        session: termination is final, and re-auth on a terminated
        session is a no-op.

        Returns the capability kinds that were unlocked, for logging by
        the (separate) re-auth API endpoint. No-op (returns ``()``) when
