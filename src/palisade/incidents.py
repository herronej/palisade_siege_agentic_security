Incident manager for PALISADE.

This module ships the incident classifier: a thin wrapper
around Python's `logging` that emits structured records at
SEV1/SEV2/SEV3 severity, and drives the playbook actions described
in main proposal §2.3 through its wired collaborators: SEV1
terminates the session, SEV2 elevates the trust tier and forces
re-authentication, and SEV3 logs only. Gates call
`IncidentManager.record(..)`; when a `trust_scorer` and a
`provenance` emitter are supplied (the deployed wiring), the
playbook and the audit emission run automatically.

## Severity mapping

| Level | Name | Python log level | Playbook |
|-------|------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | SEV1 | ERROR | Terminate session, preserve provenance, page on-call |
| 2 | SEV2 | WARNING | Elevate trust tier, force re-auth on next high-privilege call |
| 3 | SEV3 | INFO | Log only |

The mapping puts the *most severe* incident at the *most severe*
log level so existing log-monitoring pipelines surface SEV1
events at their existing ERROR threshold.

## Wiring

`IncidentManager` accepts optional `trust_scorer` and `provenance`
dependencies in its constructor. When present, every `record(...)`
call invokes `trust_scorer.notify_incident(...)` and
`provenance.emit_incident(...)`. Both methods are implemented:

- `TrustScorer.notify_incident()` drives the tier transitions:
  SEV1 pins the tier to TERMINATED, SEV2 elevates and requires
  re-authentication on the next high-privilege call, and SEV3 is
  score-only.
- `ProvenanceEmitter.emit_incident()` emits a structured
  `ProvenanceEvent` for the incident onto the audit trail (a no-op
  only when the master provenance flag is off).

The dependencies stay optional so a caller can leave either `None`;
this is the same defensive-None pattern used by `Gate.check_slow`
for `quarantine_agent`, letting gates and the sidecar call
`IncidentManager.record(...)` unconditionally regardless of which
collaborators a given deployment wires up.

## No-op when the master flag is off

When `settings.palisade.enabled` is False, `record(...)` is a
no-op: no log line, no trust-scorer notification, no provenance
emission. This matches the contract that other PALISADE
components observe (`TrustScorer.record_violation` etc.) and means
gates can call this unconditionally.

# orphan-hierarchy path "palisade.incidents". Ops filters on
# `palisade.incidents` will catch every incident.
