"""
PALISADE contract library.

The neuro-symbolic "hard constraint" layer: deterministic, model-free
checks that bound scientific claims the agent emits. Public surface:

  * `Contract`, `ContractResult` -- the DSL.
  * `register`, `default_registry`, `ContractRegistry` -- registration.
  * `load_contract_library` -- the loader the sidecar calls.

This package also contains non-Python contract data used by other gates
(the `semgrep/` ruleset for G4 and `jailbreak_signatures.txt` for G1);
those are read by path and are unaffected by this package's exports.
