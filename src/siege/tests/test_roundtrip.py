"""
End-to-end round-trip test -- the work item's headline acceptance
criterion:

  "One synthetic B1 direct-injection instance round-trips end-to-end
   (loader -> SessionRunner -> trace recorder -> scorer)."

We load the bundled B1.1 instance off disk, run it under the baseline
(no gates) and the first G1-live config (``+G4+G3+G1`` in the B4-first
ablation), and assert the scorer reports a successful attack at baseline
and a blocked attack once G1 is live -- i.e. every stage of the pipeline
produced a usable artifact and the ASR moves the way the boundary -> gate
mapping says it should. The companion benign instance must run clean
through the ``full`` config (the §B false-positive set wiring).
