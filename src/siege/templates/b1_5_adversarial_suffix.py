"""
B1.5 -- GCG-style adversarial suffix.

A benign-seeming cover request carries an appended, gradient-optimized-
looking token string. The suffix is the load-bearing piece: the fast-tier
regex sees only the innocuous cover and the nonsense tail, so it does not
fire (high-ASR cell by design). The defense of record is the slow-tier
Q-LLM, which returns low confidence on a garbled tail and default-denies.

This template wraps the shared ``gcg_suffix`` G1 generator, drawing five
distinct cover+suffix pairs off the RNG.
